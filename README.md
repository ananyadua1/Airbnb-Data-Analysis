🏠 Airbnb Open Data Analysis
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Insights

This project explores and analyzes the Airbnb Open Data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends about property types, locations, prices, host behaviors, and reviews. The goal is to draw insights that can help understand the Airbnb market dynamics and customer preferences.

📘 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset

Understanding room types and neighborhood trends

Examining price distribution and service fees

Analyzing host verification and review patterns

Visualizing key insights using charts and graphs

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas – Data handling and cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization and analysis

Plotly – Interactive data visualizations

NumPy – Numerical computations

Google Colab – Execution environment

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key steps:

Removed duplicates and missing values

Formatted currency and date columns

Standardized data types for analysis

Filtered out unrealistic or extreme values

📈 Key Insights

Entire homes and apartments are the most common room types.

Neighborhood groups significantly influence average prices.

Verified hosts tend to receive higher ratings and more bookings.

Service fees often correlate with overall pricing trends.

Certain neighborhoods consistently attract higher demand.

📊 Visualizations

The analysis includes visual representations of:

Room type distribution

Neighborhood group comparison

Average price per location

Relationship between price, service fee, and reviews

Host verification vs. rating scores

💡 Lessons Learned

Data cleaning is crucial before visualization.

Outliers can heavily influence trend interpretation.

Visual storytelling helps communicate findings effectively.

Open datasets can be powerful tools for learning real-world data analysis.

🗺️ Future Enhancements

Add interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash or Tableau.

Integrate geospatial analysis using Folium.

Build a machine learning model to predict listing prices.

Automate the data pipeline for continuous insights.
